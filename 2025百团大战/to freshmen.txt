亲爱的同学：
很高兴在2025年的新学期相遇！我是阅读社现任社长，胡奕。这是我的浙江大学邮箱。您可以用这种方式找到我，也可以加我的个人微信。我的微信号是HUYI48555949。对我来说微信交流可能会更方便，但请记得在发送好友申请时注明您的姓名和来意。
这封邮件意在邀请您成为阅读社核心社员中的一名。我注意到您在入社问卷中表达了组织活动的热情。成为核心社员是组织活动的必要条件，在稍后的交流中，我也将说明阅读社的运行现状以及对您一些小小的期望。
首先非常感谢您加入阅读社。我代表阅读社全体社员诚挚欢迎您的到来，并期待您带来的活力，深思与崭新见解。目前本社正在规划/尚处于探讨状态的活动有：
1. 书本盲盒
   已经开始了，预计持续到书拿完/9.28日。目前第一批材料耗尽，处于补货阶段。
2. 月度书会
   月度读书分享会，主题随意，符合价值观即可。由主办人决定具体书目&主题。
3. 主题书会
   主要与节日/重大事件相关。由主办人决定具体书目&主题。第一场主题书会初步定于9.27晚6：30开始，预计持续90分钟，主题书目为《终结的感觉》，与图书馆&文学社联合举办。
4. 共读时间
   每周六RC-1 106共读时间，鼓励社员花1-2个小时阅读。允许讨论。活动预计十月开始正式举行。无需报名，需要一个社员驻场维持秩序&负责场地的开关。
5. 集体外出
   商讨中，尚无具体安排。
6. 读书笔记漂流
 将在十月开启，九月下旬开始招募参与者。负责人为核心之一。

以上是对阅读社今年规划的简单介绍。再次感谢您愿意支持阅读社的发展。我们也邀请您在百团大战（9.20下午）当天光临阅读社摊位一叙。请记得联系我来让我更好地了解您对阅读社活动/任何方面的展望，您希望在阅读社找到的精神/感受/经历，或者如果您只是单纯对这个社团感兴趣而愿意加入我们，以便我作出更加符合您期待的安排。
感谢您的时间和参与意愿。纸墨，时光与我们共同翩跹。

Dear Friend,
It's a pleasure to meet you in the new semester of 2025! I am Hu Yi, the current president of the Reading Club. This is my Zhejiang University email address. You can reach me through this email or contact me on WeChat. My WeChat ID is HUYI48555949. While WeChat may be more convenient for communication, please remember to include your name and purpose when sending a friend request.
This email is an invitation for you to become a core member of the Reading Club. I noticed your enthusiasm for organizing activities in your membership questionnaire. Core membership is essential for event planning. In our upcoming discussions, I will also outline the club's current operations and share some modest expectations for your involvement.
First, thank you for joining the Reading Club. On behalf of all members, I sincerely welcome you and look forward to the energy, thoughtful insights, and fresh perspectives you bring to us. Current activities being planned or under discussion include:
1. Blind Date with a Book
Already underway, expected to run until books are depleted or September 28th. First batch of materials has been exhausted and is currently being restocked.
2. Monthly Book Club
Monthly book-sharing sessions with flexible themes aligned with our values. Specific books and topics will be determined by the organizer.
3. Themed Book Clubs
Primarily tied to holidays or significant events. Specific books and topics will be determined by the organizer. The first themed book club is tentatively scheduled for September 27 at 6:30 PM, lasting approximately 90 minutes. The featured book is The Sense of an Ending, co-hosted with the Library & Literature Club.
4. Shared Reading Time
Weekly sessions held Saturdays in RC-1 106. Members are encouraged to spend 1-2 hours reading. Discussion is permitted. Activities are expected to commence formally in October. No registration required. One member must be present to maintain order and manage facility access.
5. Group Outings
Under discussion; no specific arrangements yet.
6. Drifting Notes: Reading and Sharing Thoughts
Launching in October; participant recruitment begins in late September. One core member is dispatched to oversee this initiative.

The above outlines the Reading Club's plans for this year. We sincerely appreciate your continued support for our club's development. We also invite you to visit our booth during the Hundred Clubs Competition (September 20th, afternoon) for a chat. Please remember to reach out to me so I can better understand your expectations for the Reading Society's activities or any other aspects, the spirit/feelings/experiences you hope to find here, or if you're simply interested in joining us. This will help me tailor arrangements that better meet your expectations.
Thank you for your time and willingness to participate. Paper, ink, and time dance together with us.
