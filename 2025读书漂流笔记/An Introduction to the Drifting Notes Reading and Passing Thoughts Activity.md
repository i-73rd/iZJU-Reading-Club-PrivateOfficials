### An Introduction to the "Drifting Notes: Reading and Passing Thoughts" Activity

We are pleased to announce a new and engaging activity for our members: "Drifting Notes: Reading and Passing Thoughts." This initiative aims to create a unique, shared literary experience, fostering a deeper connection among our reading club members through the timeless act of written reflection.

**Objective:**

The core of this activity is a single journal, our "drifting note," which will serve as a collective diary for our members. It is a space to share personal reflections, literary discoveries, and moments of inspiration, creating a tapestry of our group's thoughts and experiences over time.

**Procedure:**

Participation in this activity will proceed as follows:

1.  **Established Order:** A circulation order for the "drifting note" will be determined this September. Each member will have a designated turn to contribute.
2.  **Personal Contribution:** When you receive the journal, you are invited to fill a page (or more) with your reflections. The topic is open-ended; you may wish to write about:
    *   Your thoughts on life and personal experiences.
    *   A commentary on a book you are currently reading.
    *   A review or reflection on a recent film.
    *   Any other musings or ideas you wish to share with the group.
3.  **Optional Anonymity:** Participants have the choice to sign their entry or to contribute anonymously. The focus is on the shared thoughts and the collective nature of the journal.
4.  **Passing the Note:** Once you have completed your entry, please contact the designated activity coordinator. They will then facilitate the transfer of the "drifting note" to the next participant in the agreed-upon sequence.

We believe this activity will be a meaningful way to connect with one another on a different level, creating a lasting artifact of our shared journey as a reading club. We look forward to your thoughtful contributions.
